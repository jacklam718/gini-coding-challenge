## Challenge Description

Create a Connect 4 game which allows two players to play simultaneously on one device. The game should be able to detect all possible win states. Bonus for candidates who write necessary tests.

This project is initialized using [create-create-native-app](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app), with the addition of Jest being already installed for you. Feel free to install any other necessary dependencies.

## What is Connect 4? 

Connect Four (also known as Captain's Mistress, Four Up, Plot Four, Find Four, Four in a Row, Four in a Line, Drop Four, and Gravitrips (in Soviet Union)) is a two-player connection game in which the players first choose a color and then take turns dropping one colored disc from the top into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs. Connect Four is a solved game. The first player can always win by playing the right moves.
